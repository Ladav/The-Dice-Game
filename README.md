Pig-Game is a multi player game, in which two players compete to achieve a score by rolling a dice.

Each player alternates turns rolling the die. The player who rolls the die gets to accumulate points based on the number that they rolled.
Each time a player rolls the die, they have the option to HOLD their current value and pass their turn. The turn player gets to roll as
many times as they want as long as they DO NOT roll a 1. If they roll a 1, all the points that they accumulated that turn is lost and it 
becomes the other player's turn.
